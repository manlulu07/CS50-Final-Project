#### Description:
This is a application that allows the user to register an account then login using their login details. The main function of the application is to control a wifi car 
made using an node mcu 1. The application is a flask application and it communicates with the node mcu through web sockets. the application asks for the ip address that the node mcu is connected to and then it communicates with the node mcu via that address. The body of the car has been designed using fusion360 by myself and 3D printed. See Luther ESP car project file for more details.

My project consists of one big folder called project and within that folder there are 2 sub folders caled staic and templates, there are also python files namely app.py and helpers.py and a database file. In the static folder there are 2 files namely style.css this file contains all the styling of all html pages in this application and then there is script.js which contains the javascript responsible for the communication between the node mcu and the web applicatiob .
